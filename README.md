This web application was a project designed to bring the front-end students of The Iron Yard together
with the back end students and learn from one another.  We created a landing page that is able to be personalized to GET data from .json sources called on by the user. 

##### In working on this project here are some items I became familiar with 

* Wrting in [haml](https://github.com/Mathdrquinn/Team3/tree/master/app/views/welcome)
* Writing in [erb](https://github.com/Mathdrquinn/Team3/blob/master/app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb)
* Navigating and using the asset pipeline
* Ruby Controllers
 
##### My contributions to the project were 

* Creating the majority of the [Sass class styles](https://github.com/mathdrquinn/Team3/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/styles.scss)
* Creating the [angular modules](https://github.com/Mathdrquinn/Team3/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/app.js)
* Writing the [controllers](https://github.com/Mathdrquinn/Team3/tree/master/app/assets/javascripts/controllers) and [services](https://github.com/Mathdrquinn/Team3/tree/master/app/assets/javascripts/services) for the angular modules.
* Using [$http](https://github.com/Mathdrquinn/Team3/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/services/userHome/redditSvc.js) to GET .json data and display it in the browser
* Wrting the ng-view for [the root page](https://github.com/Mathdrquinn/Team3/blob/master/app/assets/templates/home/home.html)
